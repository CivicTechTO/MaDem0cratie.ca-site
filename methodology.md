### Seed comments

We setup the initial consultation process with a set of seed comments to kick-start the conversation. These seed comments were derived from statements mentioned in the MPs reports from their respective town hall meetings on electoral reformÂ which can be found [here](http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/HOC/Committee/421/ERRE/WebDoc/WD8405589/Members_Reports-e.html).

### How commenting works

We invite you to share your own perspectives. Once you have expressed your agreement/disagreement or passed on all statements, feel free to submit a statement of your own if you feel that it is an essential piece to the national conversation about electoral reform.

### Why moderate the conversation?

We are using a strict moderation process where all comments will first be approved before being visible to other visitors of mydem0cracy.ca. We are using this moderation process to reduce repetitive statements and to assure all statements are relevant to the conversation. We will release all submitted statements as part of our open data policy in order to be as transparent as possible about how statements were moderated.
