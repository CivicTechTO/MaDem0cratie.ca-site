We're using an open source software tool called [Pol.is](https://pol.is/home).

Why are we using this tool? The developers have said it best [on their
website](https://docs.pol.is/welcome/Motivation.html):

> We wanted a comment system to be able to **handle 'big' and stay coherent**. If
millions of people were going to show up to a conversation, the internet needed
something that would scale up.
>
> We wanted people to feel **safe**.
>
> We wanted people to feel **listened to**.
>
> We wanted people to be able to **jump into a conversation** at any time in its
life-cycle. We did not want them to feel intimidated or exhausted by the
complexity of what had already occurred. That meant ditching threading and
direct replies, so that comments didn't twist into a tangled nest.
>
> We wanted everyone to be able to **get a sense** of what others felt, and what the
consensus was, in seconds.
>
> We wanted to **preserve minority opinions**. We donâ€™t use downvoting to invalidate
upvoting. We don't use upvoting to invalidate upvoting. If we did, like other
comment systems do: 200 upvotes + 200 downvotes = net zero votes. That math
obscures the fact that there was some minority who felt differently, which we
take as data to preserve. As we iterated, this took the form of creating and
showing opinion groups.
>
> We wanted to create a system that **increased the number of roles available**. More
roles means more data, and more interesting outcomes. Somewhere south of 1% of
users comment. Most users lurk - read but don't interact in the community.
Pol.is typically sees 10x more people vote than those who comment.
>
> We wanted to **produce lots of usable data**.
>
> We wanted to **show people as grouped with those who felt similarly**. It's
satisfying and validating to find your tribe.
>
> We wanted to **restrict** the power of individuals to ruin a conversation with bad
behavior.
>
> We wanted to **avoid the echo chamber** effect of social networks.
>
> Most generally, we want to:
>
> * **provide transparency**,
> * **produce insight**,
> * **decentralize power**
>
> in all kinds of organizations of people everywhere on Earth.
