# MyDemocracy.ca / MaDem0cratie.ca

This citizen-led project aspires to create a participatory consultation
experience around Canadian electoral reform. I was inspired by the
[official Government of Canada citizen survey
tool](http://mydemocracy.ca/).

**Note:** This is an independent effort by citizens. It is in no way
endorsed or supported by the Government of Canada.


### Organization of Repo

We are serving the site from GitHub Pages, a free hosting service of
GitHub.

There are two sites, to serve both official languages. Having said that,
we strive for a single codebase. GitHub Pages has the limitation where
it only allows hosting one website per project repository. Since we need
two sites, we simple host the same code in two repos. Each language
lives on its own Git branch. We are working to keep these branches as
similar as possible.
