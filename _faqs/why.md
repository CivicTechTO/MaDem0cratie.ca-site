question: Why did you create this?

We want to help our peers participate in building an intelligent
consensus around important issues like electoral reform. We hope this
tool can help pave the way for a more transparent, constructive, and
citizen-led consultation process that helps our fellow citizens better
shape public dialogue on key issues.
