question: Who created this website?

The creation of this website was spearheaded by [Derek
Howard](https://github.com/derekhoward/) and [Patrick
Connolly](https://github.com/patcon), with the support of other members of the
[Civic Tech Toronto](http://civictech.ca/) community. It was built over the
course of two [weekly hacknights](http://meetup.com/Civic-Tech-Toronto/).
