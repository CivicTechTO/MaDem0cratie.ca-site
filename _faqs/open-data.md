question: What's this about an "open data policy"?
---

As explained in the _Open Data_ section of our [Privacy Policy](/privacy), we
intend to release an anonymized dataset. We will make it available no later
than the closing date (Dec. 31), but ideally during the data collection phase
itself.

We do this because we recognize that even with a great visualization built into
the Pol.is tool, the data will have more stories to tell. We'd like to invite
third-parties to explore the data more fully. We feel this will enrich the
overall public conversation.
