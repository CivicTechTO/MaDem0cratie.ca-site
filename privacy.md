This privacy policy (this "Policy") describes the collection of personal information
by MyDem0cracy.ca ("MyDem0cracy", "we", "us") from users of our websites at
[mydem0cracy.ca](mydem0cracy.ca) and [madem0cratie.ca](madem0cratie.ca) (the
"Websites"). When we rely on third-party services, we try to direct users
toward their respective privacy policies, and summarize important aspects.

### Pol.is

Since we use the Pol.is tool ("Pol.is") through embedding it on our website, you are
accepting [their privacy policy][polis-privacy] when interacting this instance
of their tool (the "Pol.is Conversation").

You may choose to **sign in** to the Pol.is Conversation using **Facebook or
Twitter**. You may also choose to interact **anonymously** without sign in.

Should you choose to provide Pol.is your email to subscribe to updates on this
Pol.is conversation, we will not have access to your email.

### Open Data

We plan to release an open data set (the "Dataset) made up of all comments and
votes submitted in the Pol.is Conversation. This will include comments that did
not make it through moderation.

This Dataset will associate comments and votes made by the same person, HOWEVER
it will NOT include emails used to subscribe to Pol.is Conversation updates,
nor any other single unique identifier. We do not wish to include unique
identifier, nor could we, as we have no access to these email addresses.

**Note:** Even though there will be no attached identifiers in the dataset (ie. no
emails), answering many very specific question could in theory de-anonymize
you. For example, imagine you were to answer "Yes" to the following questions:

* I live in an area code starting with "M6G".
* I identify as LGBTQ.
* I am a political science major.

A third party may theoretically be able to identify you in the public dataset,
using information you reveal elsewhere online. This is not specific to our
Pol.is Conversation, but is an underappreciated reality of our networked world.
Risk may be small, but we would like you to be informed. This relates to [information
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory).

In light of the above, please be aware that you may "pass" on voting on any
given comment. We encourage you to do so with information you would rather not
share.

[Panotoclick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/) is a tool that beautifully
illustrate the above concepts.
