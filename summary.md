The Government of Canada has been thinking about electoral reform, and talking to citizens about it. We hope this citizen-run website can be a place to improve the ongoing conversation among citizens, complementing government efforts.

* Please click “Share your perspective…” to add your comments.
* Your "perspective" can be either feelings or facts -- starting with "I think..." or "I am..."
* New comments should be standalone and should not respond to other comments.
* For complicated perspectives, please split them into simpler comments. These will be easier for others to vote on.
* Do not use questions.



(Note: This system is not for counting the number of people holding each opinion, but to understand both the diverse “opinion groups” and also the “majority opinions” shared by all. It's about understanding different types of consensus. People with the same opinions are represented as a single group. We welcome everyone to share their views.)
